While the promise of generative AI is boundless, it comes hand-in-hand with unique security considerations. In this course, AWS-certified software programmer and DevOps advocate Dipali Kulshrestha explores generative AI as a tool to revolutionize customer experiences, innovate uncharted applications, and elevate organizational productivity, while also discussing the corresponding security considerations. Learn about Amazon Bedrock and the very convenient way it provides to simplify generative AI development, with foundation models from Amazon and leading AI startups. Explore the architectures, data flows, and security-related aspects of model fine-tuning, as well as the prompting and inference phases. Plus, find out how Amazon Bedrock uses AWS security services and capabilities, such as AWS KMS, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
